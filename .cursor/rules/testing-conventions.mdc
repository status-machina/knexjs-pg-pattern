# Test Conventions

**Framework:** Vitest

Test will either focus on:
- functionality
    - typical for testing individual methods outputs
- behavior
    - for testing larger output
    - SHOULD clearly annotate actions taken and test expected state/outcomes after each outcome

Absolutes:
- Tests SHALL be written in a way that they can run in parallel
    - Setup for each test MUST NOT be dependent on actions in another test
    - The output of each test MUST NOT be influence by the actions of other tests
    - Shared setup should be handled by reusable utility functions that can be called at the beginning of each test
- Tests SHALL use the compiled code from the `dist` folder and SHALL NOT use the code from the `src` folder
